    ``x / (1 + x)`` is the obvious way to write this and is what shipped until
    now. It is also a performance bug: ``x`` is not a bound value but the
    ``ts_rank_cd(search_vector, plainto_tsquery(...))`` expression itself, and
    SQLAlchemy inlines an expression at every site that names it, so writing it
    twice makes Postgres evaluate the ranking function twice. The
    algebraically identical

        x / (1 + x)  ==  1 - 1/(1 + x)

    names ``x`` once, halving the renders contributed by this factor.

    WHAT THIS DOES AND DOES NOT BUY. Compiling the real ``memory_scored_search``
    statement, ``ts_rank_cd(`` goes from **18 renders to 9** (and
    ``plainto_tsquery(`` 27 -> 18). NOT to 1: ``similarity`` names ``fts_score``
    in both branches of its CASE, ``score`` inlines ``similarity``, and both are
    output columns of the scored CTE — so four live references remain, times the
    UNION'd reserved branch. Getting to 1 means projecting ``similarity`` and
    ``vec_sim`` once in an inner derived table and computing ``score`` over
    that; it also needs a real optimisation barrier, because with references
    still live Postgres flattens a plain subquery and re-substitutes. That is a
    separate change to the hot path, with its own plan-shape review.

    Measured in isolation on a 31,446-memory corpus with genuine multi-term
    matches (scoring 2 renders vs 1, ordered and limited): **32-39% faster**
    across queries matching 1,875-11,505 rows — 92.0ms -> 56.4ms at 11,505,
    medians of 7 runs. Read that as the gain on the FTS scoring component
    alone; the full search also paid the pgvector distance more than once per
    row (two evaluations per scanned row at the default function cost; see the
    two-layer note in ``memory_scored_search``), so end-to-end it is smaller.

    NOT bit-identical, and the difference is real but negligible: the two forms
    disagree by at most one ULP (measured max ``|a - b|`` = 5.55e-17 over every
    matching row of that corpus). That is ~4 orders of magnitude below the

        attribute with no value, which the RDF comparison reads as a claim that
        nothing can conflict with — worse than leaving the row untouched.

        Returns ``True`` when the row was updated; ``False`` when it is absent,

        ``min_similarity`` (A1 #16): cosine-similarity cutoff applied

        back-compat with single-tier callers; A1 #16's tier-dispatching
        pipeline step passes ``SEMANTIC_DEDUP_JUDGE_THRESHOLD`` (0.85)
        so candidates in the judge band become visible.

        ``agent_id`` (CAURA-721): pins the write's owner, so a candidate
        belonging to a DIFFERENT agent in the same fleet cannot refuse
        it. Without it this lookup dedups on ``(tenant, fleet)`` while
        the exact-hash gate beside it dedups on
        ``(tenant, fleet, agent, content_hash)`` — see
        ``uq_memories_live_content_hash``, whose own comment gives the
        rule both gates are meant to share: "two agents recording
        identical content are two independent observations". Only the
        semantic tier disagreed, so an exact cross-agent duplicate was
        admitted while a mere paraphrase of it was refused.

        The refusal was not a deduplication: reads can be narrowed with
        ``filter_agent_id``, so the refused agent could not retrieve the
        row that replaced its write — for ``scope_agent`` candidates the
        409 also returned the id of a row the caller cannot read.

        Same fix, same reason, as A54 on
        ``memory_find_entity_overlap_candidates`` below; that one is
        gated on the ``scope_agent`` tier only because visibility there
        selects a chain to link INTO, whereas a write gate has to be no
        wider than the narrowest scope a reader may ask for.

        Defaults to ``None`` — meaning "do not pin" — so existing
        callers keep the pre-CAURA-721 behaviour until they pass it, and
        a core-api newer than its storage degrades to over-rejection
        rather than failing.

        Returns ``(memory, similarity)`` or ``None``. The similarity
        field is what callers use to decide auto-reject vs judge-dispatch
        vs accept (see ``check_semantic_duplicate.py``).

        ``include_supersedes`` (A4 #11): when True, also return the
        ``conflicted`` row that ``memory_id``'s chain points at — i.e.
        the candidate Path A retracted FOR this memory. Path C uses
        this to re-judge Path A's verdict (A4 #13).

        Filter direction: a row M is included via this branch iff
        ``M.status == 'conflicted'`` AND
        ``memory_id``'s ``supersedes_id`` field equals ``M.id``. This
        matches Path A's chain shape — the *newer/active* row carries
        ``supersedes_id`` pointing back at the *older/conflicted* row;
        the conflicted row itself has ``supersedes_id=NULL``.

        The original A4 #11 (PR #185) used ``Memory.supersedes_id ==
        memory_id`` instead, which was structurally inverted — it
        looked for "conflicted rows pointing at me" but Path A leaves
        the conflicted row's ``supersedes_id`` as NULL. That filter
        matched zero production rows. See
        ``flow-debug-contradiction-chain-shape`` memory for the
        investigation that surfaced it.

        Default ``False`` preserves the back-compat behaviour for every
        existing caller.

        Audit oss-0814-m-37. This was two queries behind two endpoints, and
        core-api drove them in a serial N+1: fetch a page of ``(id, embedding)``
        candidates, then issue one neighbour POST **per candidate**, each body
        carrying that candidate's embedding straight back up. At the shipped
        ``CRYSTALLIZER_DEDUP_BATCH_SIZE`` of 500 that is 501 HTTP round-trips
        and ~22 MB of vector JSON per batch (a 1024-dim pgvector serialises to
        ~22 KB, down once as the candidate and up again as the query), for a
        similarity that pgvector was computing server-side the whole time — the
        vector was never read by core-api, only relayed. The correlated
        ``LATERAL`` expresses the same per-candidate top-K the loop did, so the
        ANN index is still probed once per candidate; what goes away is the
        round-trip and the relay, not the work.

        M-61 lives here now, in both halves. LIVE rows only on BOTH sides of the
        join, which is what closes the reported loop: a crystallized fact stays
        >=0.95 similar to the sources it was merged from — that is what made
        them a cluster — and those sources are ARCHIVED by the run that created
        it. Offering them again re-formed the cluster {F, S1, S2} on the next
        sweep, re-sent it to the LLM, and then archived F, because the archive
        step takes every cluster member and does not care that one of them is
        the crystal produced an hour earlier. Filtering one side would not have
        been enough: a pair is (candidate, neighbour), so a row excluded from
        one end still reaches a cluster through the other.

        Deliberately ``LIVE_MEMORY_STATUSES`` rather than ``!= 'archived'``:
        ``outdated`` and ``conflicted`` are no better as merge inputs, and naming
        the live set means a status added later is excluded by default rather
        than silently admitted.

        ``deleted_at IS NULL`` alone was never the filter that mattered:
        soft-deletion is not the state crystallization puts its sources into.

        The trailing ``c.id`` / ``nb.id`` sort keys make an order Postgres never
        promised deterministic rather than changing one it did. Candidates tie
        on ``created_at`` and neighbours tie on distance; under a tie the old
        loop's visit order — and therefore which pairs survive
        ``CRYSTALLIZER_MAX_DEDUP_PAIRS`` — was whatever the executor happened to
        emit. Similarity is symmetric, so a tie never changed a pair's recorded
        score, only which pairs made the cap.

        Returns ``False`` when the memory is not in ``tenant_id`` or any named
        entity is not, having written nothing; ``True`` when the links are in.

        ``memory_entity_links`` has no ``tenant_id`` of its own, so the join row
        cannot carry a predicate — but both parents do (``Memory.tenant_id``,
        ``Entity.tenant_id``), which is what makes an existence check sufficient
        and a schema change unnecessary.

        **Both sides are load-bearing and neither implies the other.** Checking
        only the memory lets a caller staple a foreign entity onto their own
        memory, pulling another tenant's graph node into their namespace;
        checking only the entities lets them staple their own entity onto a
        foreign memory. The two failures are independent, so the checks are too.

        One ``False`` for "no such memory", "not your memory" and "not your
        entity" alike: distinguishing them would answer as an existence oracle
        for memory and entity UUIDs, which is the thing a service that
        authenticates nothing (GHSA-wgvw-28pq-jc36) must not do.

        The check and the insert share a session and neither parent's
        ``tenant_id`` is caller-writable — ``_ENTITY_UPDATABLE_FIELDS`` omits it
        on entities (#1081) and ``_MEMORY_IMMUTABLE_FIELDS`` names it on
        memories (#1118) — so a row cannot change hands between the two.

        Shares ``_owned_link_endpoints`` with the two ``POST /entities/links``
        paths (#1124), so all three writers to this join table resolve ownership
        the same way and a fix to one cannot miss the others.

        same visibility scoping (``agent_id`` doubles as visibility identity AND
        author filter; when omitted, ``scope_agent`` rows are excluded so totals
        match what a non-semantic list would return), same single-pass GROUPING
        SETS aggregation, same cross-tenant widening + ``by_tenant`` breakdown,
        and same ``include_deleted`` CTE. Read-only (reader replica).

        ``include_scope_agent`` (default False keeps the historical MCP
        ``caura_stats`` behaviour) opts into counting agent-private
        (``scope_agent``) rows in the no-``agent_id`` team/org aggregate. This is
        a pure COUNT — no memory content is returned — so private rows can be
        tallied without leaking their contents; the report uses it so
        ``durable_memories_written`` reflects everything an agent wrote, not just
        what it shared. Ignored when ``agent_id`` is set (that path already
        scopes visibility to the named agent).

        per candidate, so a Path C run with 40 candidates at ~3 links each
        made ~120 calls where one ``IN`` does. The per-id route stays: it is
        the single-row read and this is not a replacement for it.

        Same tenant predicate as ``entity_get_by_id``, for the same reason
        (GHSA-wgvw-28pq-jc36) — knowing a UUID is not entitlement to the row
        behind it, and a batch read is the *sharper* version of that primitive
        because one request can name many ids.

        FILTER, not reject, on a partial match: an id outside ``tenant_id`` is
        simply absent from the returned mapping, which is already how a
        non-existent id answers. That is the same choice #1162 made for the
        entity-link batch read, and it is the only coherent one here — a list
        request cannot 404 "one of these" without telling the caller *which*
        of the ids exist elsewhere, i.e. becoming the existence oracle the
        per-id 404 deliberately is not.

        Returns a mapping so the caller can look up by id without scanning;
        callers must treat a missing key as "no such entity for me", never as
        an error.

        ``evidence_memory_id`` (latest non-NULL write wins; a caller
        that omits/NULLs the field does NOT wipe an existing evidence
        link). ``fleet_id`` is **first-writer-wins**: it is not part of
        the unique constraint and is intentionally NOT touched by the
        UPDATE clause. The returned ``Relation``'s ``fleet_id`` may
        therefore differ from ``data["fleet_id"]`` if the row was
        originally created by a different fleet — callers that surface
        the response to clients should treat the returned fleet_id as
        authoritative. The row id is preserved across upserts so
        callers reading by id still find the relation.

        M-64. Both entity ends must belong to ``data["tenant_id"]``, and this is
        the only place that can enforce it. The FKs require the rows to exist in
        SOME tenant, not this one; ``Relation.tenant_id`` describes the edge, not
        its endpoints; and upstream ``core-api`` (``entity_service.upsert_relation``)
        only calls ``enforce_tenant`` on the body before forwarding the raw ids.

        Unenforced, a write key for tenant T could point an edge at a victim
        entity UUID in tenant U and then read U's ``canonical_name`` and
        ``attributes`` straight back out of ``relation_get_outgoing``. Refusing
        the write is the half that stops new ones being created; the tenant
        predicate added to that reader is what closes the rows already there.

        Raises ``ValueError`` — which the router maps to 409 — with the same
        message whichever end is at fault, and the same message a nonexistent id
        gets. See ``_RELATION_REJECTED``.

        """Clear the graph rows mined out of a LIVE memory whose content changed.

        The twin of ``memory_purge_entity_artifacts`` below, and deliberately a
        separate method rather than a flag on it. That one refuses anything not
        soft-deleted, and its docstring gives the reason: the guard should not
        be an invariant living in the callers' heads. A boolean parameter would
        put it straight back there — the call site would decide which rows it
        may destroy, which is precisely what the name of the method should
        decide. So there are two names, each carrying its own guard, over one
        shared implementation.

        WHY A LIVE ROW NEEDS THIS AT ALL. Editing a memory's content re-runs
        entity extraction, and extraction only ever ADDS: ``memory_add_entity_links``
        upserts with ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` and nothing removes. So a row
        edited from "Alice joined Acme" to "Bob joined Globex" kept Alice and
        Acme — linked, related, and still ranking the row in recall for names
        its content no longer contains. The links are not merely stale; they are
        assertions about text that is gone.

        REFUSES TO RUN unless the memory is present, in this tenant, and LIVE —
        the exact complement of the purge's guard. A soft-deleted row belongs to
        the purge path, which additionally has governance's audit trail behind
        it; reaching it through here would clear the graph of a dropped memory
        under a name that says nothing about drops.

        EXTRACTION'S LINKS ONLY. ``entity_links`` on ``PATCH /memories/{id}`` is
        a caller-owned additive API — a way to tag a memory with a project or a
        person its text never literally names — and extraction, which mines
        text, will never recreate such a link. Clearing those too would destroy
        them permanently on the next content edit, with no signal to the caller,
        who need not have mentioned ``entity_links`` at all.
        ``tests/test_entity_links_are_additive.py`` already ruled on this shape:
        a shipped endpoint must not silently DELETE links a caller did not name,
        and reaching that outcome through a different code path is the same
        change. The purge below has no such carve-out, correctly — a dropped
        memory leaves nothing behind, curated or mined.

        Relations are NOT narrowed the same way, because they have no caller
        path: ``evidence_memory_id`` is written by extraction alone, so every
        relation this removes was mined from the content that changed.

        Returns the same per-table counts, and the caller is expected to
        re-extract: this leaves the memory with no extraction-derived graph
        rows, which is correct only because the ones it removes describe content
        the row no longer holds. Absent beats wrong here — a missing link makes
        the row under-recalled until extraction lands, where a stale one makes
        it recalled for the wrong thing, and no later pass ever revisits it.

        One cost this shares with the purge and does not avoid: an entity left
        fully orphaned is deleted, so a re-extraction that mines the same name
        again mints a NEW id and starts its ``attributes`` and embeddings over.
        That is bounded to entities nothing else references — invisible to every
        graph query by definition — but a caller holding such an id sees it
        stop resolving.

        H-02. The schema already says these rows must not outlive the memory:
        ``memory_entity_links.memory_id`` is ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` and
        ``relations.evidence_memory_id`` is ``ON DELETE SET NULL``. Both fire on
        a HARD delete. Governance does a SOFT delete — it sets ``deleted_at`` —
        so neither ever fires, and the entity names mined from dropped content
        (person names, under a PII policy) stay listable tenant-wide through
        ``/entities`` and ``/graph``.

        The entity row itself has no FK to the memory at all, so nothing would
        remove it even on a hard delete. That is why this is three statements
        and not one.

        Every statement is confined to ``tenant_id``. The link rows need that
        said out loud because ``memory_entity_links`` carries no ``tenant_id``
        column, so ``memory_id`` alone is an identifier and not an
        authorisation — see the comment on the guard in
        ``_delete_entity_artifacts``.

        REFUSES TO RUN unless the memory is present, in this tenant, and already
        soft-deleted; otherwise it is a no-op returning zero counts. Both callers
        check that themselves, so this changes nothing today — it is here because
        the method deletes across three tables and cannot be undone, and "only
        purge what governance actually dropped" should not be an invariant that
        lives only in the callers' heads.

        That guard is about PROVENANCE, not safety: clearing a live row's graph
        is a supported operation and has its own name, ``memory_reset_entity_artifacts``
        above. What this one refuses is doing it under a name that reads as
        governance — which would put a content edit and a policy drop in the
        same audit line. (Before the reset path existed this paragraph read as a
        safety property, warning that a caller reaching this method by mistake
        "would wipe the entity graph of a live, fully visible memory". That is
        no longer a mistake, only the wrong door.)

        Order matters and is not arbitrary:

        0. note which entities THIS memory linked to, before the links go,
        1. delete those links,
        2. delete relations whose evidence IS this memory — one row carries one
           evidence id, so a relation attributed to dropped content has no
           other justification,
        3. delete, FROM THE NOTED SET ONLY, entities now left with no links, no
           relations, and no memory naming them as its subject.

        Step 0 is what keeps step 3 honest. Deleting every entity in the tenant
        that happens to have no links would be a far larger blast radius than
        this function's job: it would sweep entities orphaned for unrelated
        reasons, and race an entity that a concurrent write has created but not
        yet linked. The candidate set is bounded to what this memory touched,
        so an unrelated orphan is left alone. Under-deleting is recoverable;
        over-deleting another caller's rows is not.

        An entity still referenced by another live memory is likewise kept — the
        name is not this memory's to remove once something else asserts it.

        One transaction: a partial purge would leave the graph half-cleaned with
        nothing recording which half.

        The tenant half of the guard is deliberately the memory end only, NOT
        ``_link_within_tenant`` (which the readers above use). That helper
        requires BOTH ends in the tenant because a read returning a straddling
        row hands back the other tenant's UUID. The question here is different
        and is purely about authority to delete: this row references a memory we
        own and are dropping, so a foreign entity on the far end is a reason to
        keep the ENTITY (the tenant-scoped delete already does) — never a reason
        to keep a link pointing at dropped content. Requiring both ends would
        leave exactly those historical straddling links behind, which is the
        leak this function exists to close.

    # (services/insights_service.py ``_query_*`` + ``_persist_findings``) and
    # the lifecycle_audit ``insights()`` activity gate VERBATIM. The 6 analytic
    # READS use ``select(Memory)`` (sidesteps the asyncpg array-cast risk and
    # matches ``memory_find_successors``); the supersede/restore UPDATEs use
    # raw ``text()`` with ``ANY(CAST(:ids AS uuid[]))`` where it's natural.
    #
    # The ``scope`` argument reconstructs ``_scope_filters``: base
    # ``tenant_id == :tid AND deleted_at IS NULL``; scope='agent' adds
    # ``agent_id == :aid`` (+ fleet when given); scope='fleet' adds
    # ``fleet_id == :fid``; scope='all' adds nothing. Every read also excludes
    # ``memory_type != 'insight'`` (feedback-loop guard). Each takes an explicit
    # ``tenant_id`` — there are no RLS GUCs server-side. Rows are returned as
    # plain dicts in the ``_rows_to_dicts`` shape the core-api prompt formatter
    # expects (NO embedding) except for discover-sample, which includes the
    # embedding (client-side k-means).

    # Content-free reasoning artifact: an episode whose content is an empty
    # thinking block carrying only an encrypted signature —
    # ``[{"type":"thinking","thinking":"","thinkingSignature":"..."}]``.
    # There is nothing for the insights LLM to analyze in these rows, yet they
    # embed near-identically and so form the tightest clusters discover can
    # find (measured on the eToro fleet: 4.3% of 30-day episodes but 23.9% of
    # all insight citations). Excluded from EVERY insights read via

        hundreds of times per window (heartbeats, polling loops, bastion
        sessions...). Feeding every instance to the insights LLM makes the
        sample one giant echo — measured on the eToro fleet, "newest 200"
        spanned under a day and ~1/3 of insight citations were repetition
        noise. Collapsing to the NEWEST row per title keeps every distinct
        activity discoverable while the ``dup_count`` / ``first_seen`` window

        Deliberately NOT used by contradictions/divergence: same-titled rows
        that disagree are precisely the evidence those modes exist to find.

        Correctness notes:
        - NULL/empty titles must not collapse into one exemplar — the dedup
          key falls back to the row id, so untitled rows all survive.
        - ``dup_count``/``first_seen`` are computed over the FILTERED set
          (the window functions run after ``filters``), so the annotation
          means "N matching rows in this window", not "N rows ever".
        - Exemplar choice is newest-by-created_at (id-desc tiebreak for
          determinism); the caller's ``order_by`` is applied AFTER the join,
          so each mode keeps its own result ordering. ``order_by`` may be a
          callable receiving the inner subquery, for modes whose ordering
          needs the window annotations themselves (failures sorts by

        The sweep fires on a daily cron at 02:00, which a heavy writing day
        outruns entirely — everything written after the tick waits ~24h for the
        janitor. Raising the cadence is the fix, but a bare cadence increase
        multiplies cost across every idle tenant, most of which wrote nothing.
        This is the gate that makes a frequent tick cheap: a tenant with no
        writes since its last COMPLETED sweep is answered in two indexed
        aggregates and never reaches the LLM.

        ``last_sweep_at`` deliberately reads only ``status="completed"`` rows,
        the same reasoning as ``_type_ii_watermark``: a run reserves its report
        with ``status="running"`` before it works, so "the latest report" is
        frequently the caller itself, and a crashed run leaves a ``running`` row
        behind forever. Either would advance the watermark past work that never
        happened, and the memories written before it would never be swept.

        Returns ``{latest_memory_at, last_sweep_at}`` as ISO strings or null and
        leaves the comparison to the caller — mirroring
        ``insights_activity_gate``, which likewise returns two timestamps rather
        than a verdict so the decision stays readable in core-api.

        ``metadata.source_outcome_id`` on the rule memory. Folding it into this
        endpoint keeps the weight clamp + the backfill in a single storage
        transaction so evolve's documented split-commit isn't widened into two

        explicit "an agent acted on this memory" signal, so it rides the same
        transaction that adjusts those rows' weights. This counter is what

        default 0 it is pure measurement (the returned-vs-used counterfactual).
        The JSONB column lives in ``metadata``, NOT a new column — no schema
        migration; the ``metadata::jsonb`` cast covers the CAURA-595 legacy

        Recomputes each ``event_hash`` and checks ``prev_hash`` linkage +
        genesis; stops at and reports the first broken link (everything
        after it is untrustworthy). A final tail-check against
        ``audit_chain_head`` catches rows deleted off the END of the chain
        (a forward walk alone can't see a missing tail).

        ``limit`` bounds one window and ``start_seq`` resumes the next: when a
        result comes back ``truncated``, its ``next_seq`` is the ``start_seq``
        for the following call. This used to say ``truncated`` was set "so the
        caller knows to paginate" while offering nothing to paginate WITH —
        there was no cursor parameter, so a chain longer than the route's 500k
        cap could never have its tail verified at all.

        A walk of every contiguous window is NOT equivalent to one full pass,
        and the difference is worth stating precisely because it is easy to
        assume otherwise.

        What DOES carry across windows is the linkage. A window above genesis
        seeds ``expected_prev`` from row ``start_seq - 1``'s stored
        ``event_hash`` rather than recomputing it, but the previous window
        recomputed that row's hash, so the chain holds transitively — and the
        terminal (empty) window anchors its tail check to that same seed, so a
        deleted tail is still caught no matter how the chain length divides by
        ``limit``.

        What does NOT carry is atomicity. One pass reads every row in a single
        REPEATABLE READ snapshot (below); a walk is N transactions across N
        snapshots, and under ``read_database_url`` possibly N replicas at
        differing lag. So a walk proves each window was intact WHEN IT WAS
        READ, not that the chain was intact at any single instant. An attacker
        with write access can therefore tamper with a region the cursor has
        already passed and have every window come back valid. That is a
        detection DELAY, not permanent evasion — the next verification that
        covers the region catches it — but a walk is the weaker statement and
        should not be reported as "chain verified" the way a full pass can be.

        Contiguity is also entirely the caller's obligation and is not
        enforced here: ``start_seq`` is a plain integer, not an opaque cursor
        bound to the previous window's ``next_seq``, and nothing records that a
        caller ever started from genesis. Verifying one window in isolation
        proves only that it is internally consistent and correctly attached to
        a row it did not itself check.

        happened -- most often because the fanout request was cancelled
        part-way through its ``gather`` and the rows it had already
        written were never reached. Such a row is not merely unreported:
        the work behind it never ran, and nothing retries it.

        Deliberately excludes ``in_progress``. That state means a
        consumer already holds the message, so republishing would
        duplicate live work. A consumer that dies mid-run gets its
        redelivery from Pub/Sub -- which is exactly the mechanism that
        does not exist for a message that was never published at all.

        ``org_id`` is a binding scope, not a convenience filter: the
        sweep's own caller passes ``UNSCOPED`` because a fanout drop is
        not confined to one tenant, but the parameter is explicit so a
        cross-tenant read is a stated choice at the call site rather
        than the default. Same shape as ``lifecycle_audit_summary``.

        ``triggered_by`` is required rather than optional because the
        two producers are not equally republishable. Fanout rows carry
        no state beyond this table -- ``fleet_id`` is always None and
        the publisher kwargs come from the per-org settings resolver --
        so they reproduce exactly. Manual rows may have carried a
        ``fleet_id`` or an operator's one-off ``retention_days``, and
        neither is persisted here, so republishing one would silently
        run a DIFFERENT job than the row records. Making the caller
        name the producer keeps that choice deliberate.

        Oldest first, so a backlog larger than ``limit`` drains in
        arrival order over successive sweeps instead of starving the

          redelivery of an already-acked successful message.

          claim was taken over while it was still running. The row is

          the duplicate run, so the caller should record it loudly
          rather than retry.

          ``org_id`` (pruned, belongs to another org, or a buggy
          publisher invented an id).

        ``finished_at`` is only stamped on terminal status values so the

        later success/failure update.

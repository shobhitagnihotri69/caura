# --- Request-body strictness (SAFE-01) ---
#
# WRITE request bodies reject unknown fields; SEARCH / FILTER / QUERY request
# bodies keep accepting them. That asymmetry is deliberate and is the whole
# point of this constant existing instead of a bare ``extra="forbid"`` sprinkled
# around — a future "tidy-up" that makes the two sides match would reintroduce
# one of the two bugs below, so each side is pinned by its own test
# (``tests/test_unknown_field_rejection.py``).
#
# WHY WRITES ARE STRICT. Pydantic's default is ``extra="ignore"``: a field the
# model does not declare is dropped without a word. On a write that means a
# misspelled key ("contnet", "memory_typ", "meta_data") returns 201 Created with
# the caller's data silently missing, and nothing in the response says so. Found
# wet-testing register/write (SAFE-01). ``extra="forbid"`` turns that into a 422
# naming the offending field — see ``app.validation_exception_handler``, which
# lifts ``extra_forbidden`` errors into the canonical envelope's message and a
# ``details.unknown_fields`` list.
#
# WHY SEARCH IS NOT. A filter that arrives misspelled returns *more* rows, not
# corrupted ones — the caller sees the wrong answer, not a wrong write. And the
# C1+C2 incident (see ``SearchRequest`` below) left the search surface carrying
# historical spellings that are absorbed by ``AliasChoices``; the permissiveness
# there is a compatibility promise to existing integrators, not an oversight.
# Product decision, not a detail to optimise.
#
# Declared aliases are NOT extra fields, so ``forbid`` never breaks an
# ``AliasChoices`` spelling. No model in the strict set below declares one
# today; the alias-safety test pins that the search aliases still work.
STRICT_WRITE_BODY = ConfigDict(extra="forbid")

# C6 — fields the SERVER owns on a memory row. A caller may never supply these
# on a write body; ``MemoryCreate._refuse_server_owned_fields`` turns them into
# an explanatory 422 instead of the generic unknown-field one. Deliberately a
# short explicit list rather than a pattern: everything not named here keeps the
# ordinary ``extra="forbid"`` behaviour, so a typo is still just a typo.

class TenantScopedBody(BaseModel):
    """Request body whose ``tenant_id`` falls back to the caller's credential.

    ``tenant_id`` was required in every request body even though the
    credential already resolves one, so the first call any agent could make
    was never the one it came for: it had to ``GET /whoami``, read the tenant
    back, and echo it into the body. Both independent probes of this API
    (Hermes and Codex, 2026-09-17) paid that round-trip before they could
    write or recall anything, and an agent that skips it gets a 422 naming a
    field whose value it was never given — a dead end unless it already knows
    the fix.

    The credential is the authority on which tenant a caller belongs to, so
    it is also the sensible default. An explicit ``tenant_id`` still wins:
    a cross-tenant read names its source tenant, and the ``enforce_tenant`` /
    ``enforce_readable_tenant`` gates in the routes are untouched and run
    against whichever value resolved. Defaulting therefore grants no access
    that naming the same tenant would not.

    **Why a validator and not ``str | None``.** Making the field optional at
    the type level is the obvious move and it is the wrong one here:
    ``body.tenant_id`` flows from these bodies deep into services typed
    ``str`` — 77 new mypy errors across governance, entity, contradiction and
    memory services on the attempt. The value is never actually absent by the
    time a route runs, so widening the type to describe a state that cannot
    be observed costs a large edit everywhere and buys nothing.

    **Why the contextvar is populated here.** FastAPI solves dependencies
    before it validates the body, so ``get_auth_context`` — and its
    ``set_current_tenant`` call — has already run by the time this validator
    executes. ``tests/test_ax_m12_tenant_from_credential.py`` pins that
    ordering, because it is a framework behaviour this depends on and not one
    we control.

# Kept to ONE line, because a model docstring becomes the schema's public
# ``description`` in ``openapi.broker.json`` — maintainer rationale belongs here, in a
# comment, not in the frozen contract. Three things about this model are load-bearing:
#
# FIELD ORDER IS THE CONTRACT. FastAPI serialises in model-field order, not dict
# order, and this endpoint has always emitted these 29 keys in this order. Reordering
# them changes the response bytes for every caller;
# ``tests/test_memory_get_serialization_contract.py`` pins it.
#
# THE TIMESTAMPS ARE ``str``, NOT ``datetime``, ON PURPOSE. They arrive as ISO strings
# — the route reads them out of core-storage-api's JSON and passes them through — and
# ``datetime`` would not merely annotate, it re-serialises: pydantic v2 renders
# ``2026-08-13T18:52:48.040997+00:00`` as ``...040997Z``. Measured, not assumed. That
# is a wire change on a live endpoint, not a side effect to take on while adding a
# schema. The fleet is already inconsistent here: ``MemoryOut`` (the POST/PATCH model)
# types them as ``datetime`` and emits the ``Z`` form for the same row. Aligning the
# two is an API decision with its own migration story; ``str`` documents what ships.
#
# NULLABILITY MIRRORS THE TABLE, plus the two computed fields that are ``None`` for an
# un-embedded row. A field marked required here that is NULL in practice turns a 200
# into a 500 via ``ResponseValidationError``, so this errs toward optional wherever the
# column is nullable.

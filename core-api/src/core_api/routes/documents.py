# are the obvious guess for one), none of which are fields on a document.
#
# The two stores took different words for the same idea and never said so: a
# memory is written as ``{"content": ...}`` and a document as
# ``{"collection", "doc_id", "data"}``, where ``data`` is a free-form JSON
# object holding the whole payload. An agent that had already used
# ``POST /memories`` sent ``{"title": ..., "content": ...}`` here and got the
# generic unknown-field 422 plus "Field required" for three fields it had never
# been told about — an error that says what is wrong with the body and nothing
# about what a right one looks like.
#
# This list only changes the MESSAGE. Deliberately NAMED rather than a category
# (same discipline as ``SERVER_OWNED_MEMORY_FIELDS``): an unrecognised key that
# is not on it is still just a typo and keeps the ordinary unknown-field 422,
# which is the correct answer for a typo.
#
# And deliberately not an alias into ``data``. Accepting ``content`` at the top
# level would not rescue the body that motivated this — ``collection`` and
# ``doc_id`` have no safe default (see ``_explain_document_shape``), so such a
# request still fails and still needs to be told the shape. It would buy a
# second spelling for the payload on a store whose own history says extra
# spellings of a body field cannot be made correct (CAURA-717, see
# ``core_api.services.doc_indexing``), plus a precedence rule for a caller that

        """ax-0917-m-13 — answer a memories-shaped body with the document shape.

        Fires only when the body borrows a name from
        ``_FIELDS_THAT_BELONG_IN_DATA``. Every other invalid body keeps the 422
        it already had, per-field ``loc`` included.

        WHY THE MESSAGE IS THE FIX, and not a default or an alias. The naive
        body cannot be made to succeed, because the two fields it is missing
        are the two that cannot be invented:

        * ``doc_id`` — the write is an upsert idempotent on
          ``(collection, doc_id)``. A server-minted id would silently convert
          it into create-every-time: the same call issued twice would leave two
          rows, a retry after a timeout would duplicate rather than converge,
          and the C34 shrink guard in ``postgres_service.document_upsert``
          (which compares a write against the row it is about to replace) would
          have nothing to compare against. That is a change to what the
          endpoint MEANS, sold as a convenience.
        * ``collection`` — a default is a shared namespace, and the doc_id
          inside it is the upsert key, so two callers who both accept the
          default and pick the same obvious doc_id silently overwrite each
          other's document.

        So the request fails either way and the only open question is what it
        is told. It is told the shape, with a body it can send — the same move
        as the ``NO_SUCH_ROUTE`` 404, which answers a wrong path by naming the
        real ones instead of just "not that".

        ``mode="before"`` sees the raw payload, which is what this needs: by
        the time ``extra="forbid"`` has run, the request is already several
        errors that individually name fields and collectively explain nothing.

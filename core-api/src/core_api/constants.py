# ``pipeline.steps.search.load_and_serialize``, and outcome inference's failure

# below has to stay ordered against it, and an ordering between two literals in
# different modules is one nobody can see. It lives in this file, not beside the
# pool, because ``storage_client`` imports ``config.settings`` at module scope —
# so the validator that enforces the ordering cannot import from there without a
# cycle (``config`` builds ``Settings()`` at import).
#
# NB both sibling HTTP clients sit at 15.0 (``OPENAI_HTTPX_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``,
# ``EMBEDDING_HTTPX_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``), each raised from 5.0 after Cloud Run
# VPC-connector cold connects overran it — the same failure class as the probe
# flapping below. Whether storage should follow is deliberately NOT settled here:
# this value governs every storage call, not just the probe.
STORAGE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 5.0

# httpx read ceiling on every storage call (``StorageClient._make_pool``). See
# that docstring for why it sits above the bulk route's own budget rather than
# level with it.
#
# Named rather than inline because it is now a CONSTRAINT as well as a setting:
# an application-level budget that means to cancel a slow storage call itself
# has to fire before this, or httpx fires first and the caller gets an opaque
# ``ReadTimeout('')`` instead of an error naming the tenant and the budget.
# ``Settings._validate_timeout_ordering`` enforces that at startup.
#
# It is NOT ``PLATFORM_REQUEST_CEILING_SECONDS``. Both are 120.0 today and the
# equality is a coincidence -- one is this process's client, the other is what
# Cloud Run/nginx sever inbound. Raising either alone must not be read as
# raising the other, which is why the validator checks against both.
# Only ``read`` is named: ``write`` happens to share the value and has no
# ordering contract to enforce.
STORAGE_READ_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 120.0

# Upper bound on a single dependency probe (storage / redis / event_bus).
# Shared between ``/health`` (binary 503 deploy gate) and ``/stats`` /
# ``/status`` (public endpoints with the same posture — return ``0`` /
# "unreachable" rather than block landing-page hits).
#
# MUST stay strictly above STORAGE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, enforced at startup
# by ``Settings._validate_timeout_ordering``. At 5.0 the two were EQUAL, so the
# probe could absorb none of the five connect retries ``CONNECT_PHASE_MAX_ATTEMPTS``
# deliberately grants — one slow connection setup and ``wait_for`` lost the race
# by construction. In prod that reported ``storage: unreachable`` on ~0.8% of
# probes while storage was healthy: the abandoned request, kept alive by
# ``_cancel_safe``'s shield, completed 200 in ~30ms about 10ms after the probe
# had already given up.
#
# 12.0 clears one connect attempt, a backoff and a second attempt (5.0 + ~0.22
# + 5.0), so the probe reflects the resilience the client actually has instead
# of failing ahead of its own first retry. That is above the 10s edge of the
# "Cloud Run gives health checks 10-30s" window this comment used to cite as a
# reason to stay well below it — which was never the operative constraint here:
# this deployment configures no Cloud Run liveness or readiness probe at all
# (TCP startupProbe only), so the consumers are the deploy gate, the compose
# healthcheck (whose own ``timeout`` must exceed this — see docker-compose.yml)
# and an external uptime monitor. The two I/O probes run concurrently, so this
# is the ceiling for the whole call rather than a per-dependency budget to be
# summed.

# so that exactly one string backs both the route decorator and the
# access-log suppression in ``middleware/request_observation.py``. Those two
# have to agree or successful-probe traffic silently returns to the logs, and
# a shared constant makes disagreement impossible instead of merely
# detectable — renaming the endpoint moves the suppression with it.
#
# These are ROUTER-RELATIVE, which is what ``scope["route"].path`` carries and
# therefore what the access log's ``http_route`` label is. ``app.py`` serves
# them under ``include_router(prefix="/api/v1")``, so the URL a caller hits is
# ``/api/v1/health`` while the label is ``/health``. Keep that distinction:

# promote routes (``routes.stm._check_stm_enabled``) and the write path
# (``services.memory_service``, reached by POST /memories with
# write_mode='stm').
#
# ONE constant because the two had drifted. The read door's text was rewritten
# once already, on the grounds that "Set USE_STM=true" is advice the reader it
# reaches cannot act on — USE_STM is a server setting and the caller hitting
# this is a hosted one. The write door kept the old wording, so a single
# capability had two doors telling the caller different things to do next.
# Sharing the string is what stops that recurring; agreement enforced by
# comparing two copies of the text can only ever notice the drift after it
# happens.
# How short-term memory is written over REST — one sentence, because it was
# three, and two of them were wrong.

# docstring. It was true of the dedicated routes and false of the capability:
# POST /memories with write_mode='stm' runs the STM write pipeline. It is gated
# on the same USE_STM setting, so the claim held for the hosted deployment and
# was false for exactly the self-hosted readers its last sentence addressed.
#
# app.py's SAFE-01 note already argues this case for its own text: "the same
# fact written twenty-five times has twenty-five chances to go stale, and the
# copy that gets forgotten is the one someone reads."

# ``memories.content`` directly). Docs themselves are only searchable via their
# ``data["summary"]`` embedding, and ``caura_recall`` never returns documents.
#
# The memory content is the whole ``data`` payload rendered as text (CAURA-717),
# so the cutoff is simply the memory schema ceiling: mint whenever the RENDER
# fits in a memory at all. Note the render is slightly longer than any one field
# — ``key: `` labels and blank-line separators — so a doc can be under the cap
# on its body and over it once rendered. Over-cutoff payloads are SKIPPED rather

# throw that away. (And ``reference`` was never an option: it is not a

# ── Document search (``caura_doc op=search`` / ``POST /documents/search``) ──
# Deliberately NOT ``MAX_SEARCH_TOP_K``, which bounds MEMORY search. A memory
# row is an enriched, summarised row; a document row is the caller's own body,
# returned whole and bounded only by ``MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH``, so a page of 50
# can already be ~500 KB. The two ceilings have never been equal and coupling
# them would import a limit chosen for a different payload — but each was a
# bare literal repeated across its surfaces, which is the drift both constants
# exist to remove. Raise this only alongside a projected result shape
# (``summary`` + ``doc_id``); on the current shape a bigger page is a bigger
# blob, not better retrieval.
#
# Both surfaces must agree on the number and enforce it DIFFERENTLY: REST
# rejects an over-cap ``top_k`` (422, via ``DocSearchRequest``'s ``le=``) while
# MCP clamps silently, because a tool signature is read by a model that never
# sees the validation error. Same ceiling, two behaviours — so the ceiling has

# signals; this is the *unit conversion* that makes the preference meaningful.
#
# The input to the derivation: migration 001 builds ``search_vector`` as a bare
# ``to_tsvector('english', content)`` with no ``setweight``, so every lexeme is
# weight D = 0.1 and a modal single-occurrence match scores ts_rank_cd = 0.1 →
# 0.0909, against measured cosine of 0.35-0.39. Re-derive if that trigger starts
# weighting lexemes; changing FTS_WEIGHT alone does NOT require it.
#
# Why 6: derived, not tuned. k*0.1/(1+k*0.1) ≈ 0.37 lands a modal match in the
# cosine range. Do not treat it as a free dial.
#

# penalty is not a constant factor, so a spread-out multi-term match still lands
# well below the band. That residual is arguably right — spread terms are a worse
# match — but it means "effective ≈ nominal weight" describes the typical query,
# not a global property. A corpus of spread-term queries will measure lower; that
# is not the scale being broken.

    enough — for a gate within the margin of the cap that clamp lands exactly ON

    raised the gate to a legitimate value below it. So when the full margin doesn't
    fit, take the midpoint of the remaining room, which is strictly inside the

# the MCP tool so the two surfaces cannot drift into saying different things
# about the same state.
#
# Agents are taught to call keystones at every session start and obey what comes
# back. A tenant that never authored a rule pays that round-trip and receives
# ``count: 0`` — which is indistinguishable, to the caller, from "this tenant
# has no standing policy", from "authoring failed", and from "you asked the
# wrong scope". The agent's reasonable inference is the first, so it stops
# asking and carries standing constraints in recall instead, which is the exact
# thing keystones exist to prevent.
#
# Emitted ONLY on the empty result, so tenants with rules pay nothing, and it is
# a RESPONSE field rather than schema — it does not touch the ``tools/list``
# token ceiling that ``_AGENT_ID_DESC`` had to respect
# (tests/test_mcp_token_budget.py).

    The server-internal write paths — auto-chunk children and the atomic-fact

    without ever consulting a dedup lookup. The public bulk path does consult
    one (``existing_hashes`` + ``first_writer`` in ``create_memories_bulk``),
    and the single-write path has ``CheckExactDuplicate``; those two
    server-internal paths had neither. That is why prod carries duplicate
    content-hash groups with no concurrency involved at all: the same document
    re-chunked, or an LLM emitting the same fact twice, minted a fresh row
    every time.

    ``_auto_chunk_request_id()`` cannot substitute for this. It mints a fresh
    UUID per item per call, so the attempt-idempotency index
    (``ix_memories_attempt_unique``) sees every re-run as a brand-new attempt —
    it makes a *retried* batch idempotent only when the caller replays the same
    ids, which these callers never do.

    Scope is ``(tenant, fleet, agent, content_hash)`` over live rows, matching
    ``memory_find_by_content_hash`` exactly, so a child is judged a duplicate by
    the same rule the single-write gate would apply to it.

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT CLOSE. It is check-then-insert, so two concurrent runs can
    both pass the check and both insert — two overlapping redeliveries enriching
    the same parent, or two racing auto-chunk requests for the same document.
    Nothing here can prevent that; only a unique constraint can, and adding one
    is the second half of #814. So this closes the source that needs NO
    concurrency to fire — which is the source prod's duplicate groups actually
    came from — and leaves the race for the index. Do not read a green here as

      ``live_hashes``.
    * **repeated within this batch** — two children of the SAME call carrying
      identical content. A unique index cannot resolve this one: the conflict is
      between two rows of a single INSERT, so it has to be collapsed before the
      statement runs.

    Applied to the FACTS, before the parent insert and before the batch embed,
    rather than to the finished child payloads. Two things fall out of that
    ordering, and both matter more than the slightly earlier call site:

    * the parent's ``child_count`` is the number of children that will exist,
      not the number the chunker proposed — otherwise this change would make
      that field silently wrong;
    * a dropped child never costs an embedding. The embed is the expensive part
      of this path, and it is a batch call, so paying for text we are about to
      discard would be the dominant cost of deduping at all.

    Dropping rather than collapsing-and-reporting is deliberate: these children
    are derived rows, not caller-submitted items. Nothing the CALLER holds
    indexes into them — the parent memory is what a caller gets back either
    way — so there is no per-item result to point at a survivor.

    Both auto-chunk handlers do now consume ``create_memories``' return value
    (H-09, to queue a re-embed for a child that landed unembedded), which an
    earlier version of this docstring cited as "discarded entirely". That does
    not reopen the question: the results are joined by ``client_request_id``,
    which each surviving payload carries, so a fact dropped HERE — before any
    payload is built — simply has no entry to be misaligned against. It is a

    latter populated whether or not this attempt was the one that committed
    the row. Callers need them to queue a re-embed for a child inserted
    without a vector.

    ``None`` means NOTHING WAS WRITTEN by this call (the duplicate refusal
    below); ``[]`` means there was nothing to write. The distinction is not

    written already exist. Every other failure still propagates, because for

    The batch is all-or-nothing — ON CONFLICT cannot arbitrate a second index, so
    one refused row aborts the statement. So this can drop children that were NOT
    duplicates, which is why it logs at WARNING with the count: the parent's
    ``child_count`` will overstate what exists, and this line is the only record
    of the gap.

    Empty list short-circuits: dedup can empty it (a document re-chunked with

    Audit H-09. ``get_embeddings_batch`` raises on every provider-side error,
    gate saturation, quota and misconfig — its own docstring notes that both
    bulk callers wrap it. Both auto-chunk callers run it AFTER the parent row
    is committed and OUTSIDE the request's ``try/finally``, so an escaping
    exception produced:

      - silent data loss: no children written, while the parent's metadata
        claimed ``auto_chunked`` and ``child_count=N``, leaving the source
        document unrecallable and nothing recording why;
      - no backfills: parent enrich, entity extraction and parent embed all
        sit below this call, so a parent inserted with ``embedding=None``
        stayed unembedded — the 2026-07-27 stranded-rows shape;
      - a PERMANENT wedge, the part that made it unrecoverable: the retry
        re-chunks, hits the same full-document ``content_hash``, and migration
        040's live-row uniqueness answers 409 against the childless parent.
        The children could never be written without deleting the parent by
        hand.

    Two asymmetries settle the policy. The parent's own embed already degrades
    to ``None`` on these same failures, so the parent commits unembedded rather
    than failing; and the child INSERT already degrades for this exact reason —
    see :func:`_insert_children_or_degrade`. The child EMBED between them was
    the only step that still raised.

    Deliberately NOT mode-dependent like the bulk path, which fails the request
    under ``inline_embedding``. There nothing has persisted when the embed
    fails, so refusing is clean. Here the parent is committed, which inverts
    the trade: refusing loses the children AND wedges every retry, while
    degrading keeps the facts and leaves a repair queued.

    Two callers: the auto-chunk children and the atomic-fact fan-out (OSS 08/14
    L-38, which batched an embed it used to issue one fact at a time). They
    differ in ``background`` and in nothing else, which is why it is a parameter
    and not a second helper — the degrade decision above is identical for both,
    and two copies of it with only one of them fixed is exactly what H-09 was.
    ``test_the_degrade_policy_lives_in_one_place`` pins one definition and one
    raw ``get_embeddings_batch`` call.

    ``background`` is the caller's position relative to a live request, and it
    must be passed rather than assumed: auto-chunk children are embedded while
    the caller waits on the create (``False`` — foreground priority, same as the
    parent's own embed), whereas the fan-out runs inside a fire-and-forget task
    with no request behind it (``True``), and must not outrank the requests it

    that never enabled it is how ~430 memories were stranded in the 2026-07-27
    incident this module already carries a postmortem for.
    ``_schedule_embed_or_reembed`` publishes EMBED_REQUESTED in deferred mode
    and retries in-process otherwise, so it covers both.

    Payloads are joined to results by ``client_request_id``, NOT by position,
    mirroring ``create_memories_bulk``. Position would in fact work today —
    ``memory_add_all`` builds its response by iterating the input and looking
    each id up in a dict, so "one entry per item in input order" is guaranteed
    by construction rather than merely documented. The join is what makes that
    guarantee stop mattering, and it is free: ``client_request_id`` is
    MANDATORY on every item (``memory_add_all`` refuses a batch without it),
    so there is no case where the key is absent to key on.

    Worth the paranoia because of what this loop does with the pairing rather
    than how likely it is to break. A mispaired entry does not drop a repair —
    it embeds THIS payload's text and persists the vector against ANOTHER
    child's row, leaving that row's embedding silently inconsistent with its
    own stored content. That is a recall-quality corruption with no error and
    no log, on a path that only runs when the provider is already degraded.
    A missing entry now takes the loud no-id branch instead of shifting every
    subsequent pair by one.

    NOTHING here may raise. This runs after the parent AND the children are
    committed, so an escaping exception would answer a fully-persisted write
    with a 500 — the exact H-09 shape, moved from the embed step to the repair
    step. The scheduling is guarded per child, so one bad id costs one
    unrepaired row rather than the whole sweep.

        #      successful — while the retried content was never written.
        #
        # And this is not an exotic caller mistake. The route answers 207

    not". The row lands in ``unknown_provenance``, which is documented as
    meaning "written before migration 037" and which nothing re-embeds
    (both embedding backfills select ``embedding IS NULL``, and these rows
    have one), so it leaves the staleness detector's reach permanently. No
    error, no log, no failed request. Measured 2026-09-04: 241 such rows,
    all bulk-created, one tenant.

    Threaded in rather than derived here, because ``_content_hash`` hashes
    ``tenant:fleet:content``: computing it without the fleet would produce
    a wrong hash for every fleet-scoped memory, which is worse than the
    NULL it replaces, since a wrong hash reads as verified freshness. A
    scalar because a bulk batch is single-fleet by construction --
    ``memory_add_all`` rejects a batch whose items disagree on ``fleet_id``
    -- and the route resolves ``body.fleet_id`` before the insert, so this
    is the value the rows carry.

        One helper rather than five copies at the call sites below, because

        Routes through the inline/deferred router rather than calling

        to EMBED_REQUESTED, so the retry lives on Pub/Sub (redelivery +
        DLQ) instead of in this process.

    After enrichment completes, applies the patch to the row and — when
    configured — runs governance remediation and the atomic-fact fan-out.

    It does NOT schedule entity extraction or contradiction detection.
    ``ScheduleBackgroundTasks`` owns both: extraction unconditionally, and Path A
    contradiction detection gated on ``embedding is not None``. This docstring
    claimed otherwise for as long as it has existed — half wrongly even before
    OSS 09/02 L-20 removed the duplicate extraction fire from here, since the
    contradiction trigger had already moved out under F3 Phase 3 — and a reader
    who believed it would conclude a second extraction pass still happens on
    this path.

    Returns the enriched row as governance needs to see it — ``id``, ``content``,
    ``tenant_id``, ``agent_id`` and the merged ``metadata_`` — or ``None`` when
    there is no live governed row to describe: enrichment disabled, the call
    failed, the row went away, or governance DROPPED it. See the assembly site
    below for why it is not re-read.

    Non-``None`` therefore means "this row exists and has been governed", which
    is the reading a caller is most likely to assume. Returning the pre-drop
    snapshot instead would hand the next caller a dict for a row that had just
    been soft-deleted. The value is diagnostics only — the sole caller discards
    it — and it is NOT a governance hook; remediation runs inside this function.

    ``governance_config`` is REQUIRED when ``run_governance_remediation`` is set,
    and passing the flag without it raises rather than crashing downstream on an
    attribute of ``None``.

    ``agent_provided_fields`` names the enrichment columns the caller set
    EXPLICITLY at write time (computed by ``_agent_provided_enrichment_fields``
    from ``model_fields_set``); those are left untouched. It is the same list
    the deferred/worker path already receives via
    ``publish_memory_enrich_request``.

    CAURA-716: this parameter previously did not exist, and the inline path
    instead inferred caller intent by comparing the row's current value against
    the schema default (``mem["memory_type"] == "fact"``, ``mem["status"] ==
    "active"``, ``mem["weight"] == 0.5``). That heuristic silently loses any
    value a caller pins TO its own default — and ``fact`` / ``active`` are
    defaults precisely because they are the sensible neutral choices, so they
    are exactly what a caller pins. Passing ``memory_type="fact",
    status="active"`` produced a row that read ``fact``/``active`` at insert and
    ``decision``/``confirmed`` seconds later. The default-comparison is retained
    as a fallback for callers that pass no list (``None``), so behaviour is
    unchanged for them.

    path; it is not attempted here.

    Precedence: per-agent profile → tenant-wide default (A47) → global constant.
    A tuned agent knob wins, the tenant default fills the gaps, the constant is
    the last word.

    Shared because there were two copies of this ladder and only one merged the
    tenant default, so a tenant-wide search default applied on the pipeline path
    alone — including the per-tenant ``fts_rank_scale = 1.0`` revert documented
    for #687.

    Scoped to RESOLUTION, deliberately: this makes both paths resolve the same
    knobs from the same sources, and does NOT make them deliver the same ranking.
    ``ClassifyQuery`` writes per-strategy ``search_param_overrides`` that
    ``ExecuteScoredSearch`` merges over the result — TEMPORAL and RECENT_CONTEXT
    both force ``freshness_floor`` / ``freshness_decay_days`` — and that happens
    on the pipeline path only. So on a query with a temporal hint the pipeline
    overrides a tenant's freshness knobs where the legacy path honours them. The
    two paths are not interchangeable; see the handoff for the full list.

    Returns every knob in ``SEARCH_KNOBS``, which is what lets one test pin the
    set for both paths at once. Callers take what they need: the wire payload is
    a projection through ``SQL_SCORING_PARAM_KEYS``; ``top_k``,
    ``min_similarity`` and ``graph_max_hops`` are core-api-local.

    ``tenant_config`` is a ``ResolvedConfig`` on the primary search/recall paths
    (routes resolve it before calling); ``None`` is tolerated so callers that
    don't have one behave exactly as before A47.

"""Per-organization settings — storage + resolution.

Settings are stored as a JSONB blob in ``organization_settings`` (one row
per organization, overrides only). Every update additionally writes a flat
diff to ``organization_settings_audit`` for attribution and history.

Resolution order for any value:
    org override (cached) → global env default (``core_api.config.Settings``)
    → hardcoded Pydantic default

The function parameters here are still named ``tenant_id`` for call-site
back-compat (CAURA-654) — the value is treated as the org-key internally.
In OSS-standalone the tenant_id IS the org_id (single implicit org per
tenant); in enterprise callers should pass the actual org_id (parameter
rename to ``org_id`` is a follow-up that will touch ~20 call sites).

Reads go through a per-process ``TTLCache`` (5-min TTL). Writes invalidate
the local cache entry immediately; other workers catch up on TTL expiry.
Cross-worker invalidation is tracked as a follow-up (see CAURA-571).

    #      patterns can't (e.g. "X is in addiction recovery"), but its RECALL is

        should be gated off for document-shaped writes, on the theory that
        2,000-character chunks are the shape it fires on.

        That question is still OPEN. The attempt to settle it against the local
        corpus failed for reasons worth knowing before anyone tries again: every
        fan-out child in that database came from benchmark conversation data,
        the non-benchmark slice produced none at all, and the corpus predates
        A70 — so it contains no worker-path fan-out, and pre-A70 deferred writes
        discarded their facts, which reads as "did not fan out". See
        docs/atomic-fact-fanout/pm-c04-fanout-rate-findings.md.

        somebody guessed. Default ON is today's behaviour; changing every
        tenant's store to address one store's regression would be the wrong
        default whichever way the measurement eventually goes.

        Off is cheaper but not free of consequence: it skips the children's

    # The WRITER, on every miss — and this is the whole fix, not half of it.
    #
    # A miss here is rarely cold. ``update_settings`` invalidates, then
    # broadcasts, and EVERY process — the publisher included, since
    # ``subscribe(broadcast=True)`` gives each its own subscription — drops its
    # copy and reloads through this function. That reload is the race: served by
    # a replica it can return the PRE-update settings and cache them for the
    # full 5 minutes, so a write meant to tighten a governance control appears
    # to land and does not take effect. Re-caching a stale value is strictly
    # worse than not caching at all — the TTL then hides the mistake for exactly
    # as long as the cache was meant to help.
    #
    # Priming the entry post-write instead was tried and is not equivalent: the
    # publisher receives its own broadcast and evicts what it just primed, so
    # the reload happens anyway and has to be correct on its own.
    #
    # The cost is bounded by the thing the cache already guarantees: at most one
    # read per tenant per TTL per process. That is what makes taking it from the
    # primary affordable here and not elsewhere.

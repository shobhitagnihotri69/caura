"""C25 — the platform/caller metadata boundary.

The write pipeline has always stored its telemetry and enrichment output
(``llm_ms``, ``summary``, ``tags``, ``write_latency_ms`` …) directly in the
CALLER's ``metadata`` dict — undocumented and collision-prone: a caller
writing ``metadata={"summary": ...}`` was silently overwritten by enrichment,
and a caller-supplied ``llm_ms`` survived as fake telemetry whenever
enrichment didn't run (MemoryImpact C9 / AX-audit N8).

This module is the single registry of platform-written keys plus the helpers
every writer goes through:

- Platform values are written to BOTH the legacy top-level key (kept for one
  release so existing consumers see no change) AND the reserved
  ``metadata["_system"]`` namespace — EXCEPT when the caller owns the key
  (``summary`` / ``tags``): then the caller's value stays at top level and
  the platform's copy lives only under ``_system``.
- Caller input is sanitised at write time: every key in
  ``PLATFORM_ONLY_KEYS`` and the ``_system`` namespace itself are stripped —
  a caller cannot inject fake platform values. That set covers more than
  telemetry: governance verdicts, dedup outcomes and row lineage are all
  forgeable in exactly the same way, and were accepted from callers until
  the registry was widened to name them.
- Read-side, ``MemoryOut.system_metadata`` is derived from ``_system`` plus
  the legacy top-level keys, so historical rows (written before this module
  existed) expose the same view without a migration.

    ax-0917-h-04. ``set_system_value`` writes every platform value TWICE (the
    legacy top-level key plus ``_system``), and the read side derives a THIRD
    copy into ``MemoryOut.system_metadata`` — so a recall row shipped the same
    ``llm_ms`` / ``write_latency_ms`` / ``semantic_dedup_ms`` / ``weight_source``
    block three times, ~1.9 KB per row against 65-82 B of actual content.

    This picks ONE location for agent-facing reads. ``system_metadata`` is the
    one that survives: it is the documented C25 read surface, it is the merged
    view (nested wins over legacy) so it is correct for historical rows too, and
    ``MemoryOut.metadata``'s own docstring already says reading platform keys
    from ``metadata`` is deprecated. NOTHING is deleted — the JSONB column is
    untouched, ``system_metadata`` carries the same values in the same response,
    and the detail read (``GET /memories/{id}``) still returns raw ``metadata``.

    ``summary`` and ``tags`` are ``CALLER_OWNABLE_KEYS``, and the read side CAN
    tell the two apart — which is why they are no longer kept unconditionally.
    ``set_system_value`` writes the top-level mirror for every platform value
    EXCEPT one whose key the caller owns, so the two cases separate cleanly at
    read time:

    * caller supplied it  -> the platform skipped the top-level write, so
      ``metadata[key]`` is the caller's value and ``_system[key]`` is the
      platform's. They DIFFER, and the caller's copy is kept.
    * platform produced it -> both writes happened, so ``metadata[key]`` and
      ``_system[key]`` are IDENTICAL. That is a mirror, not caller data, and it
      is dropped like any other platform key.

    Keeping them unconditionally made the docstring's "one location" claim false
    for these two keys: a platform-produced ``summary`` was still shipped twice
    (top level + the merged ``system_metadata`` view), just 2x instead of 3x.

    Equality is the proxy, and it has one accepted false positive: a caller who
    writes a value byte-identical to the platform's loses the top-level copy.
    That is not data loss on the wire — ``system_metadata`` carries the same
    value in the same response — and it is strictly better than shipping every
    platform-produced summary twice to protect a coincidence.

    A key with NO ``_system`` counterpart is always kept. Historical (pre-C25)
    rows have no namespace to compare against, so a mirror cannot be proven, and
    an unprovable case must not be dropped — that is the clobber C25 exists to
    prevent.

    Only None-ness is preserved; a row left with nothing caller-owned returns
    ``{}``, never None. That is the same falsy-``{}`` trap ``_dict_to_memory_out``
    guards: ``null`` and ``{}`` are different answers on the wire, and a row that
    HAS a metadata column should not report it absent just because every key in
    it was platform-written.

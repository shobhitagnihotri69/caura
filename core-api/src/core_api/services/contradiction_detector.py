"""Detect and resolve contradictions between memories on write.

P1 fixes:
- Post-commit async detection (sees all committed data, no concurrency blind spot)
- Correct supersession semantics (new_memory.supersedes_id -> old memory)
- Broader candidate search (threshold 0.70, limit 8)

Multi-provider support:
- Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter via provider layer
- Automatic fallback chain: configured provider -> fallback -> abstain
  (heuristic only when the ``fake`` provider was explicitly asked for; see

# A19 — process-wide admission gate for detection passes.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Every trigger site schedules detection with ``track_task`` (a bare
# ``asyncio.create_task``), so the per-tenant bulkheads bound how fast writes
# are ADMITTED while nothing bounds how many detections then RUN at once: the
# tasks outlive the requests that spawned them, and 8 concurrent 100-item
# bulks leave ~1,600 detection coroutines racing the moment they commit. Each
# pass holds up to ``_ENTITY_CTX_FANOUT_LIMIT`` (8) connections of the SAME
# 200-connection / 5s-pool-budget storage pool the foreground request path
# uses, plus one LLM judge call for seconds — a big enough burst surfaces as
# foreground PoolTimeouts (the 2026-06-16 incident shape) and judge abstains
# (#821), i.e. silently dropped detections. This gate turns that collapse
# into bounded concurrency + FIFO queueing.
#
# Queue, never shed: detection is post-commit background work with no caller
# waiting on it, and a shed pass is a contradiction nobody ever looks for.
# Waiting coroutines cost ~KBs; the resources the cap protects (storage pool,
# provider quota, event loop) are what actually collapse. ONE shared gate for
# every entry point — mirroring ``interview_service.synthesis_sem`` — because
# two independent Semaphore(N)s would allow 2N whenever Path A bursts overlap
# Path C bursts, exactly the stampede the cap exists to prevent. Global
# rather than per-tenant (unlike ``per_tenant_concurrency``) because the
# protected resources are process-global; a hot tenant delaying another
# tenant's BACKGROUND detection is acceptable in a way that pool exhaustion
# for everyone is not.
#
# The semaphore is cached per running loop rather than created at import:
# asyncio primitives bind to the first loop that awaits them, and the test
# suite runs one loop per test — a module-level instance would poison every
# later test with "bound to a different event loop" (same reason
# ``_bounded_gather`` builds a fresh semaphore per call). Production has one

# ── A40 — the deterministic RDF pass, callable from both triggers ─────────
#
# Extracted verbatim from ``detect_contradictions_async`` so the SAME pass can
# also run after entity extraction. It used to be reachable only at write time,
# and that made it close to dead for the facts this product is actually about.
#
# The gate needs ``(subject_entity_id, predicate, object_value)``.
# ``EmitMemoryTriple`` populates those during the write with no LLM call, but it
# resolves a SUBJECT from only two sources: a caller-supplied ``entity_links``
# row, or an identifier-shaped token. Proper nouns deliberately return None
# ("Alice", "Atlas" — see ``_infer_subject_token``), deferring to the
# entity-extraction worker's higher-precision output. Measured on this code:
#
#     "Maya lives in Boston"             predicate=lives_in          subject=None
#     "Acme is headquartered in Berlin"  predicate=headquartered_in  subject=None
#     "Priya reports to Dana"            predicate=reports_to        subject=None
#     "TOKEN-XYZ has release date 2027"  predicate=release_date      subject=TOKEN-XYZ
#
# So for any human- or company-subject fact the row commits with a NULL subject,
# this gate fails, and Path A falls straight through to the STOCHASTIC raw-text
# semantic judge — the R7 miss. Extraction then fills the columns in moments and
# fires Path C, which does entity-overlap plus another LLM judge and never
# retries the deterministic check. The one non-stochastic verdict in the module
# was structurally unreachable exactly where it was needed.
#
# Running it again post-extraction is also CHEAPER, not more expensive: Path A's
# semantic judge is gated on ``if not contradictions``, so a deterministic
# verdict SUPPRESSES an LLM call rather than adding one.
#
# Re-running is safe by construction. ``memory_find_rdf_conflicts`` selects only
# ``active``/``confirmed``/``pending`` rows, so anything an earlier pass already
# retired is out of scope, and the storage CAS (``WHERE supersedes_id IS NULL``)
# is the backstop on the chain edge.

CONTRADICTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about the
SAME real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction, even if
the predicates look opposite or the statements look semantically similar.

Statement A (NEW): {new_content}

Statement B (EXISTING): {old_content}

Follow these steps in order:

1. Extract subject_a: the entity Statement A is primarily about
   (person, company, project, product, etc.). Use a short noun phrase.
2. Extract subject_b: the entity Statement B is primarily about.
3. Decide same_subject. Set true ONLY when subject_a and subject_b refer
   to the SAME real-world entity. Treat these as same_subject=true:
     - exact name match
     - known alias / nickname / abbreviation of the same entity
     - role description and proper name referring to the same individual
       in context (e.g., "the CEO" and "Sarah Johnson" when context makes
       it unambiguous)
     - pronoun resolved unambiguously to the other statement's subject
   Treat these as same_subject=false:
     - two different people who share a first name or last name
     - two different companies, products, projects, or teams
     - any case where you are not confident the subjects are the same entity
4. Decide non_conflict_reason. Even when same_subject is true, certain
   shapes describe two claims that BOTH hold and so are NOT a
   contradiction. Pick at most one value; pick "none" when the two
   statements really do assert mutually exclusive states.
     - "temporal_supersession": BOTH statements are records of PAST
       events or completed milestones that stay true as history
       ("hired in 2020" / "promoted in 2023"; "v1 shipped in March" /
       "v2 shipped in June"). Records of what happened never compete.
       This reason does NOT apply when the statements assert a
       subject's CURRENT state or attribute and the newer one changes
       it ("status: planned" vs "status: shipped", "lives in X" vs
       "lives in Y", "runs at 01:00" vs "runs at 03:00") — a state
       change is an update, and updates ARE contradictions
       (contradicts=true, reason "none"): flagging them is how the
       stale value gets retired.
     - "list_valued_predicate": the two statements describe attributes
       of the same subject that do not compete for a single slot.
       Two shapes both qualify:
       (a) one predicate that naturally holds multiple values at the
       same time — "supports English" / "supports French"; speaks
       multiple languages; "reports_to" in matrix orgs; "works_on"
       parallel projects;
       (b) two entirely different attributes of the same subject —
       e.g., "Alice was promoted to Senior Engineer" (her title)
       and "Alice is on the platform team" (her team) are
       complementary facts; both hold simultaneously. Different
       attributes do not exclude each other.
     - "refinement": one statement is a more specific version of the
       other ("Europe" vs "Munich"; "tech" vs "Google"; "Q3" vs
       "September 15"). Both hold; finer granularity does not negate
       coarser.
     - "scope_mismatch": the statements describe the same subject with
       different implicit qualifiers — whole vs part (parent company
       vs division), different time windows (annual vs quarterly), or
       different context qualifiers (weekday vs weekend, work vs
       residence). Both can hold simultaneously.
     - "same_name_distinct_subject": subject_a and subject_b share a
       surface name but plausibly refer to different real-world
       instances (two different builds of "the nightly build", two
       different days of "today's standup", two different people both
       called "John" without disambiguator). This is the symmetric
       complement to same_subject=false for cases where the names
       happen to match.
     - "conditional_unrealized": one statement is conditional /
       hypothetical / irrealis ("if X then Y", "would", "could",
       "might"), and the other is a realised state. The conditional
       does not assert a claim that can contradict.
     - "event_restatement": the two statements describe the SAME
       event with different tense, aspect, or synonymous verbs
       ("acquired" / "is acquiring" the same deal; "was hired" /
       "joined"). They restate the same fact, not different facts.
     - "none": none of the above applies. Use this when the two
       statements really do make incompatible claims about the same
       subject at the same time frame (e.g., "X lives in Tel Aviv"
       vs "X lives in Haifa" as undated current-state claims).
   Two state claims about the same subject are also NOT a
   contradiction when BOTH statements explicitly reference
   non-overlapping past time periods (e.g., "X lived in Tel Aviv
   from 2010 to 2014" vs "X lived in Haifa from 2015 to 2018").
   In that case set non_conflict_reason="scope_mismatch".
5. Decide contradicts:
   - If same_subject is false, contradicts MUST be false.
   - If non_conflict_reason is not "none", contradicts MUST be false.
   - Otherwise contradicts is true only when the two statements assert
     mutually exclusive states about that subject in the same time
     frame. Updates / corrections about the same subject ARE
     contradictions (e.g., "X lives in Tel Aviv" vs "X lives in
     Haifa"). Do not speculate that one statement might describe a
     future state that resolves the conflict. Choose
     temporal_supersession ONLY when both statements read as records
     of past events — never merely because two states could have held
     one after the other; states that replace each other are updates,
     i.e. contradictions.

ENTITY_AWARE_CONTRADICTION_PROMPT = """\
You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system, running
the second-pass judgement after entity resolution has already linked
both statements to their canonical entities.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about
the SAME real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction,
even if the predicates look opposite or the statements look semantically
similar.

CRITICAL: Resolved entities below are AUTHORITATIVE. The subject of
each statement has ALREADY been resolved to a specific entity row
(identified by ``entity_id``) by upstream entity extraction. Your job
is NOT to re-do that resolution from raw text; your job is to use the
resolved entities as ground truth and decide whether the two
statements' CLAIMS about those entities are mutually exclusive.

  * If the two RESOLVED-ENTITIES blocks have a subject-role entity with
    the SAME ``entity_id``, the subjects ARE the same real-world entity.
    same_subject MUST be true. Surface text qualifiers ("from X", "at
    Y", "the Z", possessives, role modifiers, employer / team / location
    prefixes) are additional context about that ONE subject, NOT
    evidence of different subjects.

  * If the two RESOLVED-ENTITIES blocks have a subject-role entity with
    DIFFERENT ``entity_id`` values, the subjects are different entity
    rows. same_subject MUST be false, regardless of surface name
    similarity. (Set non_conflict_reason="same_name_distinct_subject"
    when the canonical names happen to match.)

Statement A (NEW): {new_content}
RESOLVED ENTITIES for Statement A:
{new_entities}

Statement B (EXISTING): {old_content}
RESOLVED ENTITIES for Statement B:
{old_entities}

Follow these steps in order:

1. Identify subject_a: from Statement A's resolved entities, the entity
   with role="subject" (or the canonical subject if no role is marked).
   Use its canonical name.
2. Identify subject_b: same from Statement B's resolved entities.
3. Decide same_subject MECHANICALLY by comparing the subject entities'
   ``entity_id`` values (not their surface text). Check the GUARD rules
   first; only fall through to the equality rules if no guard fires.
     - entity_id starts with "<none-" on either side -> same_subject=false
       (entity has no stable identifier; do not infer identity even if
       canonical names happen to match or the two sides happen to
       render the same "<none-..." sentinel string)
     - either side missing a subject-role entity -> same_subject=false
       (degenerate input — this prompt should not have been invoked,
       but if it is, prefer false)
     - same canonical name but different entity_type -> same_subject=false
       (two different real-world things that happen to share a name)
     - subject_a.entity_id == subject_b.entity_id ->  same_subject=true
     - subject_a.entity_id != subject_b.entity_id ->  same_subject=false
   Worked examples:
     (a) Statement A subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         Statement B subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         -> same_subject=true even if Statement A says "Priya from
         AcmeCorp" and Statement B says "Priya from BetaIndustries".
         The employer text is additional context about the one resolved
         Priya, not evidence of a different Priya.
     (b) Statement A subject: entity_id=ABC123 canonical_name="Priya"
         Statement B subject: entity_id=XYZ789 canonical_name="Priya"
         -> same_subject=false. Two distinct resolved entities that
         happen to share a canonical name; this is the
         ``same_name_distinct_subject`` non-conflict reason.
4. Decide non_conflict_reason. Even when same_subject is true, certain
   shapes describe two claims that BOTH hold and so are NOT a
   contradiction. Pick at most one value; pick "none" when the two
   statements really do assert mutually exclusive states.
     - "temporal_supersession": BOTH statements are records of PAST
       events that stay true as history ("hired in 2020" / "promoted
       in 2023"). NOT for current-state claims where the newer
       statement changes the state ("status: planned" vs "status:
       shipped", "lives in X" vs "lives in Y") — a state change is an
       update, and updates ARE contradictions (reason "none").
     - "list_valued_predicate": attributes that do not compete for a
       single slot — multi-value predicates (supports English /
       supports French) or two entirely different attributes of the
       same subject (Alice's title vs Alice's team).
     - "refinement": one statement is a more specific version of the
       other (Europe vs Munich; Q3 vs September 15). Both hold.
     - "scope_mismatch": same subject, different implicit qualifiers
       (whole vs part, different time windows, different contexts).
     - "same_name_distinct_subject": surface names match but the
       resolved entities differ — choose this when you also set
       same_subject=false because the entity blocks disambiguate.
     - "conditional_unrealized": one statement is hypothetical /
       irrealis; conditionals do not contradict realised states.
     - "event_restatement": the two statements describe the SAME event
       with different tense / aspect / synonyms.
     - "none": none of the above; the two statements assert mutually
       exclusive states about the same subject at the same time frame.
5. Decide contradicts:
   - If same_subject is false, contradicts MUST be false.
   - If non_conflict_reason is not "none", contradicts MUST be false.
   - Otherwise contradicts is true only when the two statements assert
     mutually exclusive states about that subject in the same time
     frame. Corrections / updates about the same subject ARE
     contradictions.

You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system.

A NEW statement is compared against several EXISTING candidate statements.
Judge EACH candidate INDEPENDENTLY against the NEW statement — one candidate's
verdict must NOT influence another's.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about the SAME
real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction, even if the
predicates look opposite.

NEW statement:
{new_content}

Candidate statements (judge each, by index):
{candidates_block}

For EACH candidate index decide, applying the rules in order:
1. same_subject (bool): true ONLY when the candidate and the NEW statement refer
   to the SAME real-world entity (exact name / known alias / role+name in
   context / unambiguously resolved pronoun). false for two people sharing a
   name, different companies/products/projects/teams, or any uncertainty.
2. non_conflict_reason (exactly one): "none"; "temporal_supersession"
   (BOTH statements are records of PAST events that stay true as history —
   "hired in 2020" / "promoted in 2023"; NOT for current-state claims where
   the newer statement changes the state, e.g. "lives in X" vs "lives in Y"
   or "runs at 01:00" vs "runs at 03:00" — a state change is an update and
   updates ARE contradictions, reason "none");
   "list_valued_predicate" (a multi-valued predicate or two different attributes
   that both hold); "refinement" (one is a more specific version of the other);
   "scope_mismatch" (same subject under different implicit qualifiers — time
   window / whole vs part / context; both hold); "same_name_distinct_subject"
   (same surface name, plausibly different instances); "conditional_unrealized"
   (one is hypothetical/irrealis); "event_restatement" (same event restated).
3. contradicts (bool): true ONLY when same_subject is true AND
   non_conflict_reason is "none" AND the two assert mutually exclusive states in
   the same time frame. Updates / corrections about the same subject ARE
   contradictions ("X lives in Tel Aviv" vs "X lives in Haifa").

Reply with ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences, with exactly two
keys. EVERY candidate index from 0 to N-1 must appear in exactly one of them:
- "clean": array of every candidate index (integers) where contradicts is false.
- "hits": object mapping each contradicting candidate index (as a STRING) to
  its judgment with the three fields above.
{{"clean": [1, 2, 4], "hits": {{"0": {{"same_subject": true, "non_conflict_reason": "none", "contradicts": true}}, "3": {{"same_subject": true, "non_conflict_reason": "none", "contradicts": true}}}}}}
Calibration: in most batches FEW OR NO candidates contradict — an empty "hits"
is the normal answer, not a failure to find something. Apply the three rules to
every candidate independently, exactly as if you were judging that one pair on
its own. A candidate goes in "hits" ONLY when all three rules pass decisively;
uncertainty, partial overlap, related-but-compatible claims, or any applicable
non_conflict_reason put it in "clean". Never add a hit because a batch "should"
contain one. If NO candidate contradicts, "hits" is {{}} and "clean" lists every
index.

    above 0.50 means "could not tell, parser conservative-default". With no LLM we
    are in precisely that position.

    This replaced ``_fake_contradiction_check``'s verdict on the production
    fallback, because a ``True`` here is not advisory. ``detect_contradictions``
    acts on the boolean ALONE — the confidence is unpacked as ``_confidence`` and
    only logged, since A4 #13's confidence-weighted veto is still deferred (the
    only live threshold, ``RETRACTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD``, gates retraction and
    not marking) — so it sets the older memory's ``status`` to ``"conflicted"``.

    What that costs, stated precisely rather than dramatically:

    * ``memory_scored_search`` does NOT drop every conflicted row. It keeps one that
      is an exact lexical match, un-demoted; otherwise the row is demoted and falls

    * Recovery exists but is narrow. No sweep re-checks the status, and Path C's
      retraction judge (:func:`_attempt_entity_retraction`) only restores the
      canonical direction, needs resolved entities on both sides, needs confidence
      ≥ ``RETRACTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`` (0.90), and is tenant kill-switchable.
      A flipped-direction mark is never revisited.

    Abstaining instead loses a real contradiction during an outage, which leaves a
    memory retrievable that should have been superseded — the recoverable direction,
    and the same stance ``_fake_dedup_check`` takes when it errs toward keeping a

        #       call gets a per-row suffix (``-{i}>``) so two missing
        #       rows in the same context block never render the same
        #       sentinel. ``_NONE_ID_PREFIX`` adds a process-scoped

        #       real entity_id (real ids are UUIDs written by the
        #       entity-extraction worker).
        #   (2) CROSS-side disambiguation: the prompt's same_subject
        #       step has an explicit rule that any ``<none-``-prefixed
        #       entity_id forces ``same_subject=false`` regardless of
        #       whether the two sides happen to render the same

    Same output as calling ``_fetch_entity_context`` once per memory — a
    ``{memory_id: [{name, entity_type, role, entity_id}, ...]}`` mapping,
    link order preserved per memory, missing/foreign entities dropped —
    but with the fan-out collapsed:

      1. ONE ``get_entity_links_for_memories(all_ids)``. That endpoint has
         always taken a LIST; the per-memory helper just never used it as
         one, calling it with a single-element list per candidate.
      2. ONE ``get_entities_by_ids(unique_entity_ids)``, deduplicated
         across every memory. Entity-overlap candidates are selected
         BECAUSE they share entities with the new memory, so the same
         entity row was previously refetched once per candidate that
         linked it.

    Why it mattered enough to add a storage route (#1461 context): a Path C
    detection pass fetches context for the new memory plus up to
    ``_ENTITY_LINKS_DETECTION_FETCH_MAX_CANDIDATES`` (40) candidates, and
    each of those made 1 links call + one ``get_entity`` per link. At the
    ~1-5 links per memory documented on ``_format_entity_context`` that is
    41 + ~120 ≈ 160 HTTP round-trips per run, plus 2 + ~6 more for the
    retraction phase. This is 2 per phase, flat, independent of candidate
    count.

    The admission gate (#1461) made this MORE visible, not less: it bounds
    how many runs contend at once, so a run's round-trips now sit inside a
    held slot rather than racing other runs for the pool. Round-trips per
    slot is exactly the term that sets gated throughput.

    Failure handling is deliberately unchanged from the per-memory path,
    because batching introduces failure modes single fetches did not have
    (a payload storage rejects wholesale; a route an older core-storage-api
    deployment does not serve yet — the two services deploy separately):

      * links call raises → fall back to the per-memory
        ``_fetch_entity_context`` fan-out, i.e. exactly the old code path.
      * entity batch raises or answers a non-mapping → fall back to
        per-entity ``get_entity`` hydration (see ``_hydrate_entities``).

    Never raises. Path C is post-commit best-effort; a memory that could
    not be resolved gets ``[]`` and its caller treats that as "no context",
    which is what it already did.

You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system, running
the second-pass judgement AFTER entity resolution has already linked every
statement to its canonical entities.

A NEW statement is compared against several EXISTING candidate statements.
Judge EACH candidate INDEPENDENTLY against the NEW statement — one
candidate's verdict must NOT influence another's.

CRITICAL: the RESOLVED ENTITIES blocks are AUTHORITATIVE. The subject of
each statement has ALREADY been resolved to a specific entity row
(identified by ``entity_id``) by upstream entity extraction. Do NOT re-do
that resolution from raw text; use the resolved entities as ground truth
and decide whether the two statements' CLAIMS about those entities are
mutually exclusive.
  * Same subject-role ``entity_id`` on both sides -> same_subject MUST be
    true (surface qualifiers like "from X", "at Y", possessives, employer /
    team / location prefixes are extra context about the ONE subject, NOT
    evidence of different subjects).
  * Different subject-role ``entity_id`` -> same_subject MUST be false
    regardless of surface-name similarity (set
    non_conflict_reason="same_name_distinct_subject" when the canonical
    names happen to match).
  * ``entity_id`` starting with "<none-" on either side, or a side missing
    a subject-role entity -> same_subject=false.

NEW statement: {new_content}
RESOLVED ENTITIES for the NEW statement:
{new_entities}

Candidate statements (judge each, by index):
{candidates_block}

For EACH candidate index decide, applying the rules in order:
1. same_subject (bool): decided MECHANICALLY by comparing subject-role
   ``entity_id`` values per the CRITICAL rules above.
2. non_conflict_reason (exactly one): "none"; "temporal_supersession"
   (BOTH statements are records of PAST events that stay true as history;
   NOT for current-state claims where the newer statement changes the
   state — a state change is an update and updates ARE contradictions,
   reason "none");
   "list_valued_predicate" (multi-valued predicate or two different
   attributes that both hold); "refinement" (one more specific than the
   other); "scope_mismatch" (same subject, different implicit qualifiers;
   both hold); "same_name_distinct_subject" (surface names match, resolved
   entities differ); "conditional_unrealized" (one is hypothetical /
   irrealis); "event_restatement" (same event restated).
3. contradicts (bool): true ONLY when same_subject is true AND
   non_conflict_reason is "none" AND the two assert mutually exclusive
   states in the same time frame. Corrections / updates about the same
   subject ARE contradictions.
Reply with ONLY a JSON object, no prose, no markdown fences, with exactly two
keys. EVERY candidate index from 0 to N-1 must appear in exactly one of them:
- "clean": array of every candidate index (integers) where contradicts is false.
- "hits": object mapping each contradicting candidate index (as a STRING) to
  its judgment with the three fields above.
{{"clean": [1, 2, 4], "hits": {{"0": {{"same_subject": true, "non_conflict_reason": "none", "contradicts": true}}, "3": {{"same_subject": true, "non_conflict_reason": "none", "contradicts": true}}}}}}
Calibration: in most batches FEW OR NO candidates contradict — an empty "hits"
is the normal answer, not a failure to find something. Apply the three rules to
every candidate independently, exactly as if you were judging that one pair on
its own. A candidate goes in "hits" ONLY when all three rules pass decisively;
uncertainty, partial overlap, related-but-compatible claims, or any applicable
non_conflict_reason put it in "clean". Never add a hit because a batch "should"
contain one. If NO candidate contradicts, "hits" is {{}} and "clean" lists every
index.

# A4 #13 — Retraction phase: re-judge a Path A verdict with full entity
# context and undo it via the A4 #10 storage primitive when the re-judge
# disagrees with sufficient confidence.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


# Minimum confidence the judge must report for a ``verdict=False`` to
# trigger retraction. Above this we trust the "not a contradiction"
# call; below this we leave Path A's verdict in place.
#
# CAURA-128 — tightened from 0.60 → 0.90.
#
# The retraction code was originally written as "re-judge with full
# entity context"; the comment block at A4 #13's introduction promised
# the judge would see the resolved entity_links and answer a different,
# entity-aware question than Path A's semantic similarity check. In
# practice ``_attempt_entity_retraction`` calls ``_llm_contradiction_check
# (new_content, old_content, ...)`` with the SAME prompt and SAME inputs
# as Path A's semantic judge. There is no entity context in the request
# — it is the same LLM call rolled twice.
#
# Wet-tested on memclaw.net 2026-05-26 (S2 race probe, scripts/  # legacy-name-floor: historical
# repro_contradictions_race.py). Two memories with directly conflicting
# release dates about a synthetic proper-noun subject. Path A correctly
# flagged the conflict; Path C's independent roll returned
# ``(verdict=False, confidence=0.60)`` on a non-trivial fraction of runs
# and silently retracted the correct flag. Confidence rubric:
#   0.90 — clean LLM agreement (both gates aligned on "not contradict")
#   0.85 — gate 2 fired (model named a non_conflict_reason)
#   0.60 — gate 1 fired (model said contradicts=True same_subject=False;
#          parser overrode). THIS IS THE STOCHASTIC FLIP CASE.
#   0.50 — malformed response, or a no-LLM abstain (``_skip_contradiction_*``).
#          NOT a heuristic verdict any more: the production fallback abstains.
#
# Raising the floor to 0.90 means retraction only fires on clean
# agreement — both gates of the parser say "not a contradiction" with
# no parser-override. Gate-1 (the stochastic-flip case) and gate-2
# (single-gate non_conflict_reason) both now leave Path A's verdict in
# place. This is the "quick fix" tier; the deeper fix (an entity-aware
# prompt that actually receives entity_links + canonical names) is
# tracked separately and will revisit this threshold once the judge has
# a different question to answer.

    A53 — resolution is DIRECTION-AWARE. Canonical verdicts put the edge on
    ``new_memory`` (dereference ``supersedes_id``); flipped verdicts put it on
    the pre-existing candidate and leave ``new_memory`` ``outdated`` with a NULL
    ``supersedes_id``. The previous implementation dereferenced ``new_memory``
    unconditionally and so returned False for every flipped verdict — and this
    docstring used to claim the opposite ("works in both directions"), which was
    never true. The flipped counterpart is found with a retraction-shaped
    storage lookup; a chain claimed by more than one row is left alone rather
    than guessed at.

    Retraction is a two-step write via A4 #10:
      1. ``update_memory_status(candidate.id, "active")`` — revert
         the conflicted row. Idempotent if a concurrent writer beat
         us to it.
      2. ``update_memory_status(new_memory.id, status,
         unset_supersedes=True, expected_supersedes_id=candidate.id)``
         — clear the chain edge with a CAS anchor. A 409 from the
         storage layer means someone else mutated the chain between
         our read and our write; we treat that as "the retraction is
         no longer ours to do" and swallow it.

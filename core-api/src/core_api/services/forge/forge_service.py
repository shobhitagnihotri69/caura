"""Forge service — the resident orchestrator (SF-104 part 2).

End-to-end Phase-1 pipeline:

  build session traces (SF-102)
    → filter to labeled outcomes
    → cluster by entity Jaccard overlap
    → gate clusters (volume + diversity)
    → distill each cluster via injected ``llm_fn`` (uses SF-104 prompt)
    → compute fingerprint (SF-103)
    → check poison memory (``forge_rejected_fingerprints``)
    → write skill candidate doc with status='candidate', source='forge'

Phase-1 MVP scope (per plan §15):

  * Forge runs ONLY as a manual CLI invocation (SF-106) or via
    direct call from the eval harness (SF-105).
  * Candidates ALWAYS land with ``status='candidate'``. They never
    auto-promote to ``staged`` in Phase 1 — the auto-gates that
    eventually move them are part of Phase 2.
  * No HITL surfacing — the inbox is Phase 2.

Everything that touches an external system is injected as a callable
parameter so the unit tests run hermetic:

  * ``llm_fn``        — async (prompt: str) → str (raw LLM response).
  * ``memory_fetcher`` — async (memory_ids) → dict[memory_id → content].
  * ``poison_checker`` — async (fingerprint) → bool (True = poisoned).
  * ``candidate_writer`` — async (candidate_doc) → None (persists).

The production caller wires real implementations; the eval harness
swaps in golden-output fakes.

    Two budgets bound the run, and they are not the same number.
    ``cfg.max_writes_per_run`` is spent only by a candidate that is
    actually WRITTEN; ``cfg.max_clusters_per_run`` (derived from it when

    ``origin.run_id`` on every candidate doc Forge produces. The
    caller (CLI / scheduler) is responsible for choosing a value
    that uniquely identifies this run (e.g. timestamp + tenant).

    ``status_checker`` (optional) is the no-overwrite guard. When
    supplied, Forge looks up the doc at the candidate's target slug
    BEFORE writing. If something already exists with a status other
    than ``candidate`` (i.e. it's ``active``, ``rejected``,

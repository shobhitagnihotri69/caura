"""Forge cron tick — the production scheduler entry point (SF-CR3).

Mirrors the manual ``scripts/forge_dry_run.py`` harness but wired into the
``caura.lifecycle.forge-distill-requested`` consumer so the autonomous
scheduler (Cloud Scheduler / k8s CronJob → ``POST /admin/lifecycle/
fanout/forge-distill``) drives one tick per opted-in tenant.

Decomposition:

  1. Resolve per-tenant ``ForgeConfig`` from
     ``org_settings.skills_factory.forge.*``.
  2. Wire injectables (``llm_fn``, ``memory_fetcher``, ``poison_checker``,
     ``candidate_writer``, ``status_checker``) — same shapes as the
     CLI uses, but bound to a request-scoped DB session.
  3. Invoke :func:`run_forge_distill` for the configured freshness
     window.
  4. Invoke :func:`promote_pending_candidates` so newly-minted
     candidates that pass the 6 auto-gates flow to ``staged`` in the
     same tick (no second cron tick needed for promotion).
  5. Return ``candidates_written + promoted`` for the lifecycle_audit
     row's ``stats`` block.

Why one entry point per tenant (rather than a fan-out inside the
handler): the lifecycle fanout endpoint already publishes one event
per tenant (see ``_list_tenants_with_skills_factory_enabled``), and
each event consumes ``run_label`` from the publisher kwargs. Per-tick
isolation gives the audit row + dedup window the granularity to
attribute failures to the right tenant.

    Returns the canonical MCP error envelope when the write must be refused,
    and ``None`` when it may proceed. Callers MUST return the envelope rather
    than discard it; a dropped return here is a silent un-enforcement, which is
    the failure this whole area keeps producing.

    WHICH IT DOES IS A FLAG. ``enforces_mcp_plan_limits()`` is off by default,
    and while it is off this behaves exactly as it did before — log and let the
    write through. That preserves the staging described below rather than
    discarding it: enforcement becomes available without becoming automatic.

    The refusal mirrors REST's ``AuthContext.enforce_usage_limits`` — same
    error code (``PLAN_LIMIT_READ_ONLY``), same message, same carve-out that
    deletes stay permitted so a tenant can get back under the limit. It cannot
    reuse that method directly: it raises ``HTTPException``, and MCP tools
    return envelopes.

    Step one of caura-ai/caura#1205 was to observe rather than refuse,
    which closes a real divergence — an over-plan org is refused a write on
    REST and allowed the same write on MCP — but closes it in a direction that
    takes capability AWAY from tenants who have it today. Enforcing in the same
    change that first plumbs the signal would mean discovering the blast radius
    from the support queue.

    So: emit what WOULD be refused, ship it, read the logs, then enforce with
    the number in hand.

    THE GATEWAY QUESTION IS ANSWERED — IT IS YES. This docstring used to say the
    log was the only way to learn "whether the gateway stamps
    ``x-org-read-only`` on the ``/mcp`` route or only on ``/api/v1``", because
    the header has no producer in OSS. It has one in caura-enterprise, and it
    was read there at ``origin/dev`` ``13564142``:
    ``gateway/nginx.conf.template`` gives both
    ``location = /mcp`` and ``location /mcp/`` the same
    ``auth_request_set $org_read_only`` / ``proxy_set_header X-Org-Read-Only``
    pair the ``/api/v1/`` catch-all has, alongside ``X-Gateway-Secret`` — so
    ``via_gateway`` is true and the header is honoured. The value originates in
    ``platform-auth-api``'s ``/_auth``, which sets it on an expired license, a
    cached read-only verdict, or a live storage lookup.

    READ SILENCE CAREFULLY. Three of the four reasons a quiet log was not
    evidence are now closed, and the fourth is the one that matters most.

    * The gateway skipping this route: ruled out above.
    * The batch path contributing nothing to the counters: closed in
      caura-ai/caura#1638, which turned ``meters_mcp_bulk_write()`` on.
    * ``/_auth`` failing open on its own storage lookup: it now reports
      ``x-org-read-only: unknown`` instead of nothing, and this function emits
      ``mcp_plan_limit_verdict_unknown`` for those requests. A blind sample is
      no longer silence — count it, and treat an observation window with many
      of them as not yet measured.
    * NOTHING SETS THE FLAG FROM USAGE GROWTH, and this one is still open.
      ``organizations.is_read_only`` in caura-enterprise is written to True by
      exactly one thing, the Paddle ``subscription.canceled`` downgrade. No
      sweep and no request-time check evaluates usage otherwise, and
      ``check-read-only`` only ever lifts the flag. So a tenant over its plan on
      a healthy subscription never gets stamped, and this log stays quiet no
      matter how far over they go. Until that is fixed, a quiet log is evidence
      about the STAMPING, not about the population — and flipping
      ``enforce_mcp_plan_limits`` would enforce against a signal almost nobody
      can currently receive. See the ``meter_mcp_bulk_writes`` comment in
      ``config.py`` for the verification.

    Logged at WARNING rather than INFO because a firing line means real money:
    a write that the plan says should not have happened.

    TWO EVENT NAMES, deliberately. Observing keeps emitting
    ``mcp_plan_limit_would_refuse``; enforcing emits
    ``mcp_plan_limit_refused``. Reusing one name and flipping the ``enforced``
    field would leave every existing query silently counting refusals as
    observations, and "did we actually refuse anyone" is the question the
    rollout turns on. The ``enforced`` field is kept on both so a query written
    against either name still resolves it.

# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Keystones are mandatory governance rules. They live in core-storage
# under the system-managed ``_keystones`` collection (PR1); this layer
# wraps them in MCP tools and a REST surface (route file
# ``routes/keystones.py``).
#
# Two separate handlers (not op-dispatched into one) because:
#   * Different audiences — agents READ keystones at session start,
#     admins/governance AUTHOR them. Surfacing them as two named tools
#     keeps the read tool discoverable in ``instructions`` without the
#     write surface bleeding into low-trust contexts.
#   * Different trust profiles. Read is open (``trust_required=0``).
#     Write declares ``trust_required=1`` as the minimum any successful
#     call needs, then the handler computes the per-call floor from
#     the rule's scope/agent_id: ``scope=agent`` carrying an EXPLICIT
#     ``agent_id`` equal to the caller is the self-author tier (≥1);
#     everything else stays at the cross-agent governance bar (≥2) —
#     ``scope=fleet``, ``scope=tenant``, cross-agent ``scope=agent``,
#     and also ``scope=agent`` with ``agent_id`` OMITTED, which names
#     no target and therefore cannot be self-authored. The ≥2 tier is
#     what blocks a prompt-injected freshly-registered agent from
#     planting a tenant-wide rule or impersonating another agent.
#
#     The omitted-agent_id case is the one callers trip over: the rule
#     shape is invalid anyway (storage: "scope=agent requires agent_id")
#     but the trust gate runs first, so the 403 lands before the 422.
#     ``keystone_trust_hint`` appends the remedy to that 403 rather
#     than reordering the checks — the gate must stay ahead of the
#     storage read for anti-probing reasons.

# ── SoT registration ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Triggers loading of every `core_api.tools.caura_*.py` spec module. Each
# spec module registers itself in the REGISTRY and calls `mcp_register(mcp, spec)`
# to wire the handler to the MCPServer. This import must run AFTER the `caura_*`
# handler functions above are defined — spec modules reference them via
# `core_api.mcp_server.caura_X` attribute lookup. Deliberately no count here:
# this said "the 16 handler functions" from the initial release until 2026-09,
# which was the PRE-consolidation figure and never matched the 12 that exist.
# `test_tools_registry` pins the real number; prose beside it only drifts.
# The `noqa: E402,F401` silences "module-level import not at top" and
# "imported but unused" — both are intentional.
